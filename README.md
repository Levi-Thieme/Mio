This is a instant messaging web application that was a course project started by Levi Thieme, Aaron O'Donnell, Brad Eberbach, Joseph Shell, and Isaac Harter. It is not finished but the following features work: user account creation, updating account info, creating chat rooms, adding other users to chat rooms, adding people to your friend list, and posting messages in a chat room.
